am an early-career security professional and Information Systems Security Engineer (ISSE) who focuses on building defensible networks and explaining complex topics in plain language. My work blends hands-on practice with clear technical writing, so stakeholders understand risk and can act on it.

Core interests include access control, authentication, network segmentation, and baseline troubleshooting. I work with tools such as Wireshark and Nmap, and I use GitHub Pages to publish clean, readable documentation. I value reports that front-load key points, show methods and limits, and pair prose with simple visuals.

This portfolio is highlighted by my Unit 7 long research paper and my Unit 4.2 slide deck on Tech Monopolies and Fair Competition. Both pieces examine how platform power and market structure shape technology choices and policy, and they model the kind of organized, audience-ready communication I aim to deliver. If you have feedback, a peer learning opportunity, or a project that needs clear security writing, I would welcome a conversation.
