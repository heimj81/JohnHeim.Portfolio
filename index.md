# Technical Writing Portfolio

Welcome to my technical writing portfolio. It features audience-focused work from the CIS program that emphasizes clear structure, plain language, and evidence-based analysis. The collection is most notably highlighted by my Unit 7 long research report and my Unit 4.2 slides, both covering Tech Monopolies and Fair Competition. You will also find proposals and instructional pieces that apply visual design and APA-aligned sourcing.
